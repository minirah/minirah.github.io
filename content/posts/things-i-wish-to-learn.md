If only there is a way to know everything without effort!!!

I wish to learn all these stuff either for the fun of it or because I consider these will somehow magically transform me into a better or intelligent person(which I know is not true). 
But what is life if not trying out stuff you wanna do with the limited time you have been given.

I'll update this list 

- Learn another language (probably Hindi) apart from my mother tongue & English
  - At least good enough to watch movie without subtitles and have a conversation with a stranger   
- Learn to swim
  - At least good enough to float in a place for long time 
- Learn math concepts
  - Will this make me a better person? I don't think so. Will this make me more intelligent? Nah. Will this help my career? Hell no. Why then? I don't know. Sometimes we just do things
  - This should not be rote learning like the time I did it in school. But with actual understanding and real world applications
  - From what I browsed around the common consensus seems to be start with Khan academy and go through it at a comfortable pace till you understand things clearly. Will give it a shot
- Learn haskell
  - Supposedly this language is beautiful and based on strong academic/mathematical principles. Would like to give it a shot
