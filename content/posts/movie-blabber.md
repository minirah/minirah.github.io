It's 5:50am in the morning here. Still haven't slept. Just finished watching a feel good movie. 

Irrespective of the movie, I am wondering why I like watching movies so much. It's my go-to action whenever I am alone and have some time to kill. I know most people are like this and do the same, that's why cinema is such a huge industry. I can google and get the answer for this pretty much immediately. But I want to just give it a guess, well cuz I have nothing else to blog about. So crawlers, here I come.

## Easy
It's easy. There is no almost no resistance. My laptop is hooked to charger and turned on 24x7. It's connected to high bandwidth wi-fi. My streaming services are logged in. The browser auto-completes the url for me. The recommendation algorithm might be the only failure here, cuz it never shows me what I want. So I have get a movie out of my watchlist and google it and open the appropriate streaming service.   

## Passive
This kinda overlaps with easy. I don't have to do anything other than get a bucket of popcorn/snacks to watch the movie. It's passive from then on. I can watch the work of thousands of people unwrap before my eyes, perfectly cut and edited for maximum enjoyment with zero effort. If we think more, this involves work of so many people behind the scenes to bring it to the table(/screen) - from the DARPA project which imagined internet to the guy who laid cables in our street. It's a miracle.

## Role-play
Not the kind that comes to minds of people like me, but imagining ourselves as protagonist of the movie. That gives such excitement and I become the hero of the movie almost instantly when I watch it. I almost feel the same happiness he feels in the scene. I feel the same fear. I feel the same pride. It brings me into a magical land where I am living an alternate life where the world revolves around me and I can beat 100 guys without sweating and my betrothed looks at me with such awe, the whole town looks to me for saving them. None of this is real or a healthy way for a society to function. But the moment these all happen is miraculous and I just can't stop imagining myself in the role. Man, I love movies and being center of the world. Who wouldn't? (There are no rules without exceptions - kinda self violating, but meh, it's a different topic).

This works for feel good movies. But what about realistic movies, sad movies and all? Usually I don't watch them more than once. I watch movies for escape from reality most of the time. If it shoves reality in my face, I won't like it likely, unless it has some other element which pulls me in.

## Fulfilment
Watching a movie from start to finish, though passive, gives a sense of fulfilment that I have started something and finished it completely. You can't say the same thing about work. Work is never ending. Most things in life only have a pause button. But once a movie ends, it ends. It is concluded. That satisfies the itch in life, where nothing is complete and nor have closure. Man I feel nihilistic, typing this out. But it fills the void for completeness. The protagonist usually doesn't die and gets a happy ending. Though my life is happy and better than what most people have, it lacks the closure. No I don't think I would love to know everything about to happen in my life beforehand for closure. But movies give a temporary closure which gives a bit of hope for the next day.

I can try to say more. But I feel like it'll be forced as I have to think hard before the last paragraph. There are the top things off my mind. Ciao!
