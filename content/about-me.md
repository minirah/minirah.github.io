I'm a guy from a country with more than a billion people. Not that hard to figure out which. I like people.

Enjoys in no particular order - movies, reading, company of my people, working out, hikes, short trips, long trips, vibing to music, singing along my favorite songs, arguing, play fighting,  memes, dancing like skydancer, food. A lot more stuff is not mentioned.

Based on employer, I am either a software developer or software engineer or software development engineer or project engineer.

This blog will be a mix of journaling, notes, bookmark, posts, random thoughts and what not.
